We built GCS-Modeler2D on various cutting-edge open source technologies. 
- We used Angular as the front-end web framework
- Bootstrap and HTML for the design of typography, forms, buttons and tables. Storage and management of rules and visualization data was done with Microsoft SQL Server with entity frame- work that enables us to work with data using objects of domain specific classes. The back-end of GCS-Modeler2D was written in C# language and .NET was used as server-side web-application framework. We also used technologies such as Javascript and JSON to make pages more interactive with the user, providing asynchronous information requests. Highcharts Javascript library was used for vi- sualization of geotechnical cross-sections. This charting library is written in pure JavaScript and offers an easy way of adding interactive cross-sections to our web application. Online access via web browsers is done with Internet Information Ser- vices (ISS) web server, which is a flexible, secure and manageable web server for hosting anything on the web.
